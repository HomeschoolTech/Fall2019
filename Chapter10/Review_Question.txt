1. When dealing with input and output, how is the variety of devices dealt with in most modern computers?
device drivers sending the input to I/O librarys
2. What, fundamentally, does an istream do?
takes input and reads it into the progran
3. What, funcamentally, does and ostream do?
sends output to a space where it can be used 
4. What, fundamentally, is a file? 
space where data can be red and written to 
5. What is a file format?

6. Name four different types of devices that can require I/O for a program?

7. What are the four steps for reading a file?

8. What are the four steps for writing a file?

9. Name and define the four stream states.

10. Discuss how the following input problems can be resolved:
	a. The user typing an out-of-range value
	b. Getting no value (end of file)
	c. The user typing something of the wrong type

11. In what way is input usually harder than output?

12. In what way is output usually harder than input?

13. Why do we (often) want to seperate input and output from computation?

14. What are the two most common uses of the istream member function clear()?

15. What are the usual function declarations for << and >> for a user-defined type X? (i.e. How would you begin to define a custom input/output operator for a class named X)
