## MAKE SURE YOU ARE ON BANCH chapter12 BEFORE EDITING

#***************************************************

# Makefile
I've filled out the makefile, have a look at it to understand what it does.
It has three options

1) default, this is what happens when you use the command `make` all by itself

2) Drill, compiles drill.cpp with the libraries

3) clean, deletes all files that end with ".out"

# Drill
Edit drill.cpp to include the examples from the rest of chapter 12. 
When it comes to adding an image, just download an image from online; 
make sure it is in .jpeg format. 

# When you are finished
Commit your changes. Make sure that you don't add drill.out (check via git status)
It should be ignored by the .gitignore file in Fall2019/.gitignore but just make sure.

Then push the chapter12 branch.
	
	git push origin chapter12
